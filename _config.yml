bio: "Brazilian developer. Game, music and technology lover.
      I am graduated in Systems Analysis and Development and I have a post-degree in Production and Development of Games.
      I love to study and learn new skills, exchange work and share my knowledge with the ones that want it. I work with Back-end Development since 2010 and with
